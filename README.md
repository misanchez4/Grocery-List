A Grocery List 

The list has the following options:
1. Add a task to the to-do list 
2. View the current to-do list 
3. Mark a task as completed 
4. Remove a task from the to-do list 
5. Remove all tasks from the to-do list
6. Sort the list alphabetically
7. Count the # of Items on the To-do List
8. Exit the program

This program will start out by asking you which option you would like to choose, to which you should respond with a number
The program will then ask you a question, to which you should respond with an item 
After you make your choice, the program will restart, asking you which option you would like to choose, until you choose to exit the program.
